Autotrophic microorganisms play a pivotal role in biogeochemical cycling of elements in wetland ecosystems. To support studies on autotrophic microorganisms in wetlands, we established a specialized resource for wetland autotrophic microorganisms, the Resolved Wetland Autotrophic Microbiome database (RWAMdb). The RWAMdb compiles data from 99 metagenomic samples collected across 33 wetland sites in China, encompassing diverse environments such as rich paddies, lakes, rivers, marshes and coastal wetlands. Through high-resolution metagenomic sequencing, assembly, and binning, the database includes 6,020 metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) with associated taxonomic classifications, assembly metrics, and functional annotations. A total of 2,972,145 genes were identified and annotated, enabling in-depth analyses of carbon fixation and other potentially functional pathways. Analytical tools, including BLAST for sequence alignment, pathway completeness heatmaps, and an Autotrophic Potential Analysis (APA) module, empower users to evaluate carbon fixation potential across MAGs and unknown genomes. RWAMdb provides a user-friendly web interface, freely accessible at https://rwamdb.zju.edu.cn/.
